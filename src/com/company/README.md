Morse Code
In this mini project, we are able to convert english words into morse code and vice versa.

Firstly, we ask the user whether they are going to input a word in english or in morse code.

When the user writes a word, the output is going to be in morse code separated by a | using the split method.
The same goes when the user puts a morse-coded phrase.
